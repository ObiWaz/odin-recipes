    <h1>Sausage Soup</h1>
    <img src="../img/ph-sausagesoup.jpg" />
    <h2>Fall is here!</h2>
    <p>
      This recipe is hearty, healthy and easy to make. The recipe here is
      vegetarian, but can be made with any kind of sausage. I enjoy making this
      recipe because of the "convenience factor". Most ingredients are
      premeasured in cans or cartons. It also keeps well for meal prep.

    <h3>How to</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large dutch oven heat olive oil at medium high. Add onions and cook
        until translucent.
      </li>
      <li>Once the onions are translucent, add garlic. Cook until fragrant.</li>
      <li>
        Add potatoes, beans, boullion cube, and broth. Stir everything together.
      </li>
      <li>In a seperate pan, brown the Impossible sausage.</li>
      <li>When the potatoes are al dente, add sausage.</li>
      <li>
        In the same pan the sausage was cooked in, add the butter or olive oil.
        Once the butter has melted add equal parts flour to the pan. Stir and
        mix until the roux is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the roux to the soup along with the kale. Stir until everything is
        all nice a friendly. Put the lid on and let simmer for a couple minutes.
        Medium heat.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once the potatoes are soft, turn off the heat and add the lemon zest,
        lemon juice and parsley. Stir and serve!
