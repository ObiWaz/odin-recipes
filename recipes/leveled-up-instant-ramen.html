    <h2>It's food!</h2>
    <p>
      Instant ramen doesn't have to be a shameful experience. I mean, yeah we're
      poor, and capitilism forces us to eat copius amounts of carbs and salt to
      satiate our dopamine needs. However, we can accelerate that dopamine flow
      with a few tweaks!

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <p>
      Below are a list of things to add to your ramen and when in the cooking
      process to add them.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Fried Egg - right at the end on top of the bowl of Ramen.</li>
      <li>
        Poached egg - crack an egg a couple minutes before the ramen is done.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sesame oil - right at the end before transfering to the bowl....Unless
        your bowl is the pot. That is okay too. There is no judgement here.
      </li>
      <li>Green onions - right at the end.</li>
      <li>Slice of American cheese (yes it is good) - right at the end.</li>
      <li>Splash of wine, rice vinegar, or sake - right at the end.</li>
      <li>
        Sriracha - I like to put it right at the beginning, but any time is
        fine.
      </li>
      <li>Bean sprouts - 30 seconds before done.</li>
      <li>
        Teaspon of curry powder - Right at the beginning. This is awesome by the
        way.
      </li>
      <li>Tofu - Right at the beginning.</li>
    </ul>
